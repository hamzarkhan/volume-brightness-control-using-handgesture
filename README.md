# Hand Gesture-Based Brightness and Volume Control

This project uses **Mediapipe** and **OpenCV** to control screen brightness and system volume with hand gestures.  
The **right hand** adjusts screen brightness, while the **left hand** adjusts the system volume.

## Features
- Real-time hand tracking using Mediapipe.
- Brightness control using thumb-index finger distance of the right hand.
- Volume control using thumb-index finger distance of the left hand.
- Interactive visual feedback with OpenCV.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or later.
- Webcam for capturing video.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
